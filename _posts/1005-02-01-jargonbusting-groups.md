# Jargon Busting

1. Next in groups of 4-6
2. Make a list of all the problematic terms, phrases, and ideas each pair came up with. Retain duplicates.
3. Identify common words as a starting point work together to try to explain what the terms, phrases, or ideas on your list mean. Note: use both each other and the internet as a resource.
4. Identify the terms your groups resolves as well as those you are still struggling with.
Each group then reports back on one issue resolved by their group and one issue not resolved by their group.
The instructor will collate these on a whiteboard and facilitate a discussion about what we will cover today and where you can go for help on those things we wonâ€™t cover. Any jargon or terms that will not be covered specifically are good notes.
